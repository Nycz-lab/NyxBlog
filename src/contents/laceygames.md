## Intro

Just a few days ago ive came to encounter a youtube channel called
"[ghosttundra](https://www.youtube.com/@ghosttundra)" which documents a series of so called lacey games (from the flash games era)
apparently they have been created 2004~2007 and have been lost.
The Twist is that they appear as childrens games but hide some horror aspects that are truly disturbing...

There even exists a [Website](https://laceygames.neocities.org) to the games on neocities.

## Digging...

What however bothered me is that no google search will show any related information to the Series.
For example

```
"Laceygames" before:2007-01-01 AND after:2004-01-01
```

will not yield any results at all...

However as it turns out they arent real and have been created only for the sake of the horror series on youtube.
