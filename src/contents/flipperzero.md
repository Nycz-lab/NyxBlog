## Intro

I've finally managed to buy myself a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one). Basically its a small educational hacking device
which i already managed to program in C and am working on some projects on GitHub to contribute to ^^

Working with it feels like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi
Its also a great Intro to embedded Programming

## Capabilities

It's awesome to impress people and also really useful if your remotes batteries die

However its main Functionalities are:

- Cloning & Emulating RFID
- Cloning & Emulating NFC
- Cloning & Emulating SubGhz Frequencies
- Cloning & Emulating iButton
- Cloning & Emulating Infrared
- BadUsb/BadBluetooth Aka DuckyScript

## Projects

Some Projects i want to shoutout:

- [Evil Portal](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119/flipper-zero-evil-portal)
- [WiFi Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/flipper-zero)
- [Unleashed Firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)

## Note

Sadly at this point in time the documentation for programming the flipper is not really existent
so getting resources is equivalent to reading the firmware source code and replicating the flow
of instructions from there.
Hopefully this will improve in the future
